# Java Cyberpet
🐶 A simple console game from when I was just starting to learn Java.

🐹 Run CreatePet, and try to keep your pet alive!

🦜 Requires you to be able to run Java code from source.

🐱 If you would prefer to play in your browser, see my [JavaScript version](https://www.duncanritchie.co.uk/jsChallenges/cyberpet/cyberpet.html) from February 2019 (or [the repo for that](https://github.com/DuncanRitchie/jsChallenges)).
