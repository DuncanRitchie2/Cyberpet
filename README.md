# Java Cyberpet
A simple console game from when I was just starting to learn Java. 🐹 Run CreatePet, and try to keep your pet alive! 🦜 Requires you to be able to run Java code from source. 🐱 If you would prefer to play in your browser, see my JavaScript version from February 2019: https://www.duncanritchie.co.uk/jsChallenges/cyberpet/cyberpet.html 🐶
